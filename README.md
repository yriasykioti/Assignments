# SEIP2020 Practical Assignments

The purpose of this repository is to deliver all my practical assignments which are written in Java for my course of Software Engineering in Practice.

## HistogramGenerator

The purpose of the first assignment is to make a parent Maven project and a module in order to get familiar with Maven and create an executable jar. The executable jar will read a file with grades from cmd and will generate a histogram with the grades' frequencies.
In order to make a fat jar, I added the maven-assembly-plugin in the pom.xml of the module.

## How to build
1. Set up Maven
2. Clone the repository 
3. Use the command mvn package in order to make a jar file 
4. java -jar histogramgenerator/target/histogramgenerator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar "the path and the name of the file with the grades"
